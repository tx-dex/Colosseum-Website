                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic affects all countries and communities across Europe, where the Colosseum Dental Group (CDG) operates. At CDG we have taken the situation extremely seriously since the beginning and will continue to apply all conceivable measures to keep our colleagues and patients safe.</p>
                    <p>We are continuously monitoring the situation very carefully, ensuring we collaborate with and follow the healthcare authorities´ guidance in all our markets. We continue to review travel priorities, both for business and for personal reasons for our teams and are moving our courses in our Group Academy to digital accessibility.</p>
                    <p>We are dedicated to keeping our clinics open for our patients but only in accordance with the local authorities´ guidance. The Medical Board of Colosseum Dental Group safeguards our colleagues and patients by enforcing the national healthcare authorities´ guidelines in all our dental practices and deciding on additional safety measures on a daily basis. Our clinics are operating with revised Standard Operating Procedures which reflect public health guidance specific to each country.

                                “The medical board of Colosseum Dental Group has been highly focused on the progression of the coronavirus pandemic and the impact on our clinics, patients and services. The board has remained close to developments, local country public health guidelines and most importantly our people throughout the last months. Universal precautions are designed to instil high standards of cross infection control, decontamination, and re-processing of instruments to minimise the risk of transfer of pathogens between staff members, staff and patients and also between patients.

                                The clinics within CDG already operate with very high standard operating procedures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The coronavirus is a respiratory virus that is passed on by small droplets contained in the process of breathing and airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances through procedures that generate aerosols – this applies to dental treatment where the high-speed drill is used.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The medical board has a firm belief that new universal precautions to minimise any risk to our colleagues and patients are necessary in light of the advent of COVID-19.”A major part of our new universal precautions is in relation to personal protective equipment (PPE) and reduction of the aerosol in our environments – CDG is taking this extremely seriously. We have introduced “The Colosseum Way” which means enhanced levels of PPE being used by our teams in the delivery of care and various additional measures which will reduce the risk of any infection or contamination for all involved in the procedure. The safety, well-being and psychological confidence of our clinic colleagues and patients seeking treatment is our primary focus and the Medical Board is confident that our new measures will provide reassurance and safe environments where your dental care can be carried out.”
