                Mia Grundstrøm is appointed as CEO of Colosseum Tannlege and Head of Colosseum Norway as of the 15th of
                August 2020. Mia will take over from Ole Mjåtvedt, whose assignment ends on the 30th of June. In the
                period from July 1st to August 15th, Pål Mørkved will serve both as CFO and ad interim CEO.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-content">

            <p>Mia comes from the health care industry, Aleris Helse AS, where she has worked since 2007 as CFO, Deputy
                CEO and CEO for the past few years. Mia holds a degree in economics from BI Business School. She has
                extensive experience in service development through innovation and customer experience as well as in
                project management, M&amp;A and digitalization. Mia has the expertise and experience needed to further
                develop Colosseum Norway and to contribute to our continued growth in Colosseum Dental Group.</p>

            <p>“I look forward to being part of the Colosseum Dental Group. It is with great humility that I take over
                the role of CEO for the operations in Norway. Colosseum Dental Norway is a well-run company, where the
                task ahead largely is to develop the high-quality service offering and best patient experience building
                on the solid foundation already existing together with the team”, says Mia.</p>

            <p>I want to thank Ole for his work over the past 10 months and his willingness to take on the transition
                period as interim until Mia was able to join. Ole has made a significant difference in developing our
                business in Norway as well as securing the business and supporting our people during the difficult first
                half of this year.</p>

            <p>I also thank Pål for his valuable contribution supporting the Group during the transition period.</p>

            <p>I look forward to Mia contributing her relevant experience as well as her leadership style to the Group.
                Please join me in welcoming and wishing her well in her new role.</p>

            <p>Stefan Nilsson<br>
                CEO<br>
                Colosseum Dental Group</p>
