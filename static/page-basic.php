<h3>5. Purposes for processing</h3>

<p>We will use the personal data described above for the following purposes: to identify you, to 3 supply services to you, to enter into a contract with you and for the performance of these contracts, to contact you/to communicate with you, for example via email correspondence and/ or telephone calls, to send you our invoices, to collect debts, to deal with possible disputes, to establish, defend and exercise our (legal) position, for business continuity, for a possible transaction with respect to your dental clinic. If you contact one of our local representatives listed on our website, please also check the website of our local affiliate for more information on how your personal data is processed.</p>

<p>If any kind of processing is based on your consent, we hereby inform you that you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>

<h3>6. How long will we keep your personal data?</h3>

<p>We will not store or keep your personal data for a longer period than is necessary in light of the purposes for which we process them (please refer to the purposes listed above in paragraph 5). Only where we are legally obliged to, or where this is necessary for defending our interests in the context of judicial proceedings, we will store the personal data for longer periods. Generally, Swiss law requires us to store business relevant and critical information for a period of at least ten years.</p>

<h3>7. How do we protect your personal data?</h3>

<p>We have implemented the necessary administrative, technical and organizational measures for ensuring a level of security appropriate to the specific risks that we have identified. We protect your personal data against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.</p>

<p>Further, we seek to ensure that we keep your personal data accurate and up to date. However, you are responsible for this and we kindly request that you inform us of any changes to your personal data (such as a change in your contact details).</p>

<h3>8. Do we transfer and/or share your personal data?</h3>

<p>In the context of the purposes as listed above, we may share your personal data with third parties in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We may share your personal data with other group companies of the Colosseum group for the following purposes: for performing a contract that is to the benefit of the whole Colosseum group, for administrative purposes, for quality management, if a possible transaction concerns a specific country where a Colosseum group company operates in. For an overview of the different locations where Colosseum is present, please visit <a href="/who-we-are">colosseumdental.com/who-we-are</a>.</li>
    <li>In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of insurers or a government authority such as data protection authorities. • We may engage third parties to process the personal data on our behalf (for example providers of certain IT applications that we use in the context of our activities or for assistance in our procurement activities). We will enter into the required contractual arrangements with those parties to ensure lawful and fair processing of your personal data on our behalf.</li>
    <li>We may also transfer personal data in the event of the sale or transfer of all or any part of Colosseum’s business.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where relevant, we will implement safeguards to ensure the protection of your personal data when disclosing your personal data to a third party. For example, we will enter into data processing agreements with relevant parties (providing for restrictions on the use of your personal data and obligations with respect to the protection and security of your personal data).</p>

<p>As a general rule, we do not share your personal data as set out above with other parties located in countries outside the EU and Switzerland. This may, however, be different in the event that we engage service providers in a country located outside the EU and Switzerland. In such case, we will ensure that adequate measures are taken to ensure adequate protection of your personal data in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. Generally, we will enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses (as approved by the European Commission and recognized by the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner) with the recipient of your personal data. With respect to third parties located in the United States, we will enter into these Standard Contractual Clauses, unless the third party is part of the Privacy Shield. You may contact our Group Privacy Officer (see below) if you wish to obtain a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses entered into or insight in other adequate measures taken.</p>

<h3>9. Can I access my personal data?</h3>

<p>If you want to know what personal data we have of you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “data subject access request”. All such requests must be made in writing, contain verification of your identity and be sent to the email or postal addresses shown in paragraph 12 below. In principle, there is no charge for a subject access request. If your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive (for example, if you have already been provided with the requested information in the twelve months prior to the application and have no legitimate interest in the further provision of information), a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding. We will respond to your subject access request within 30 days after receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months after the date on which we received your request. In this case you will, of course, be kept fully informed of our progress.</p>

<h3>10. What are your other rights?</h3>

<p>Under certain circumstances you have the right to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>receive additional information regarding the processing of your personal data;</li>
    <li>rectify your personal data;</li>
    <li>the erasure of your personal data;</li>
    <li>object to (part of) the processing of your personal data;</li>
    <li>the restriction of (part of) the processing of your personal data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent local data protection authority. In Switzerland, the competent data protection authority is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner:</p>

<p>Office of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner FDPIC Feldeggweg 1 CH - 3003 Berne</p>
